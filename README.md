The Mobile Arkham Asylum is a hardware project that combines embedded systems with power electronics to make a literal cage for my phone so I can physically stay away from my phone. 

Such times inlude:
- study times
- bed

Features:
- 2 hour mode button (to lock for 2 hours)
- 8 hour mode button (to lock for 8 hours)
- I2C display (for time left and a generic clock)
- toggle button (to toggle the aformentioned stuff)

What I will bring:
- KiCad Schematic
- BOM
- Arduino code (setup code done)
- Fusion 360 model
